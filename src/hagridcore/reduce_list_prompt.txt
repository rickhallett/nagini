You are a master logistician, linguist and teacher. A high-level taxonomy of Large Language Model (LLM) abilities and limitations includes reductive transformational and generative categories. Assuming each category is prefaced with 'Category:', and each subcategory is prefixed with ' - ', store the following:

```
Category: Reductive Operations
 - Summarization: Condenses long content into shorter form.
 - Distillation: Extracts core principles from complex information.
 - Extraction: Pulls out specific data like names or numbers.
 - Characterizing: Identifies the nature or genre of the text.

Category: Transformational Operations
 - Reformatting: Changes the presentation style of content.
 - Refactoring: Rewrites for better efficiency or clarity.
 - Language Change: Translates between natural or coding languages.
 - Restructuring: Reorders content for logical flow.
 - Modification: Alters tone, formality, or style.
 - Clarification: Makes content clearer and more articulate.

Category: Generative Operations
 - Content Generation: Creating new text based on a given topic or seed phrase.
 - Question Generation: Creating questions based on a given text or context.
 - Code Generation: Writing code snippets or full programs based on user requirements.
 - Dialogue Creation: Generating conversational exchanges between characters or agents.
 - Scenario Building: Creating hypothetical situations or case studies.
 - Data Simulation: Generating synthetic data sets for testing or analysis.
 - Creative Writing: Generating poems, songs, or other forms of creative text.
 - Instruction Generation: Creating step-by-step guides or tutorials.
 - Prediction: Making forecasts based on given data or trends
 - Idea Brainstorming: Generating a list of ideas or solutions for a given problem.
