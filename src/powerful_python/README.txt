Welcome! These are the coding exercises for the Powerful Python book.

Start by logging in to your account, and watching the "How To Do The
Labs" video. (Alternatively, detailed instructions are also in
LABS.txt in this folder.) Then complete helloworld.py.

You can do the labs in any order, but the best way is to do the lab
for each chapter after you read that chapter:

2. generators.py
3. listcomp.py
4. keyfunc.py
5. decorators.py
6. exceptions.py
7. properties.py
8. tddlab.txt
9. logging.py

Remember full solutions are in the "solutions" folder.

Enjoy!
